# Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)

Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) is the default binary format on Linux-based systems. It is used for executable files, object files, shared libraries, and core dumps.

Every ELF file starts with an executable header, which is just a structured series of bytes telling you that itâ€™s an ELF file, what kind of ELF file it is, and where in the file to find all the other contents.
